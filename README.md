This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Branches Structure
We use the dev branch as a staging branch, so all PR must be done toward that branch. Lastly they'll go in main. 
The branch called "landing" is the one that contains the old landing page (curently live at bitpolito.it).

## How to wok on an issue
When working on an issue you are gonna create a new branch and push on that, opening than a PR to merge from that branch to dev.
